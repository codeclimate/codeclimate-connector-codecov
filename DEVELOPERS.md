# Development

## Tests

Unit tests are under `src/__tests__`, and can be run with `yarn test`. `yarn
test --watch` can be useful while iterating on functionality, as it'll keep a
running instance and re-run relevant tests automatically when you save.

## Releases

Use `yarn publish` to release a new version of the package. This will prompt you
to enter a new version number, release it on npm, and then push the new version
to GitHub.
